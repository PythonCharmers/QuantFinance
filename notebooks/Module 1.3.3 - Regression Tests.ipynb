    "## Module 1.3: Ordinary Least Squares\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3.2 Regression Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module we will look further into Multivariate OLS and examine some of the requirements of the algorithm, as well as some of the details of the regression results we saw in the last module.\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing OLS for Linear Regression Models, there are a few assumptions that need to be met. The key ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first assumption is the key one - that is that the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ can, in fact, be described using the model $Y = X\\beta + u$. It may *not* be able to be precisely modeled this way, but it may be possible to get close enough that it doesn't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second assumption is that the expected value of $u$ is zero. There may be fluctuations in the vector $u$, but the overall expected value is 0. More formally, we assume that $E(u|X) = 0$, that is the expected value of $u$ when given $X$ is zero. If it were not, then we can alter the bias term to make it zero, which would be learned from the OLS, giving us our zero value!\n",
    "\n",
    "The third assumption is that the error term ($u$) and the data itself $X$ do not have any correlation. In other words, $u$ is unexplained error that cannot be explained by the data. Put more formally, there is no hetroskedasticity or autocorrelation between $u$ and $X$, which is a stronger assumption than the second, but along the same lines. We will cover these terms in a later module more formally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth assumption is that $X$ has a finite variance. This is sometimes (slightly incorrectly) referred to as $X$ being non-stochastic. We will investigate how variance plays into the model in several later modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fifth assumption is that there are no linear relation between the measurements (variables, columns, features) in $X$, known as having **full column rank**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of these assumptions are untrue, the resulting model does not necessarily have the properties we will discuss in the rest of this module, and the model itself might be biased or inaccurate. However, it may still be *useful* in a practical sense. For instance, if two variables are slightly linearly related, we break the last assumption, however in practice the model is generally still useful. However if they are heavily related, then the resulting model will be unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "    Like most models and concepts, there is always some debate about the definitions and assumptions behind them. Further, some people use the same term to describe different concepts. When discussing an algorithm, it would be best practice to note any key assumptions or variance from the \"norm\" that you consider. If you aren't sure, provide a reference.\n",

    "The key function here is the likelihood function, which is used to compute the AIC and BIC. The likelihood function $\\mathcal{L}(\\beta \\mid x)$ is the likelihood that the data could be generated from a model with the given parameters. From an information theory perspective, we aim to maximise the likelihood function. From a computing perspective, it is often easier to both compute the *log likelihood*, and to *minimise the negative log likelihood*. A key component of this is that computers find adding numbers easier than multiplying small numbers, and we can convert from log-space to normal-space using the following pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "$log(xy) = log(x) + log(y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with probabilities, many probability values are very small, and multiplying small numbers near zero is hard for computers. Often, they \"underflow\" and consider a very small number to just be zero, and then any product from that point on is zero. Instead, we compute the log of all numbers and add them together - no underflow!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the likelihood function (or negative log likelihood) has been computed, the maximum value it can take (when optimised) is $\\hat{L}$. From here, the AIC is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ AIC = sk - s\\ln(\\hat{L})$\n",
    "\n",
    "The BIC is defined similarly:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ BIC = \\ln(n)k - 2\\ln({\\hat L})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically the BIC is preferred, as it is more stable in most circumstances. However, for the BIC to be valid, the number of samples must be much more than the number of parameters."
