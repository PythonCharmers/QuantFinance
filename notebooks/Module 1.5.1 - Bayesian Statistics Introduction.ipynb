    "## Module 1.5: Bayesian inference\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.5.1 Bayesian Statistics Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical / frequentist statistics interprets a probability as a limit of many identical trials. In the strict frequentist viewpoint, a statement such as \"The probability that party X will win the election\" is meaningless; the election will only take place once, under one set of circumstances, and will not be repeated -- so the outcome cannot be observed repeatedly and the probability of this cannot be computed. Likewise, the strict frequentist perspective is that it is meaningless to discuss probabilities associated with model parameters and other fixed but unknown quantities, such as whether it is raining right now (if you are holed up in a building). It is either raining or it is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, it is useful to be able to reason quantitatively about events that cannot and will not be repeated, or about model parameters that are fixed but unobserved, or about quantities that are fixed (deterministic) but unknown. This requires either a frequentist methodology combined with inaccurate statistical reasoning (which is rife) or a Bayesian interpretation of probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Bayesian perspective, a probability encodes a degree of certainty about a proposition. It is \"subjective\": you and I may have different beliefs about a proposition. With the proposition \"it is raining\", if you heard yesterday's weather forecast, and I didn't, we may assign different probabilities the same proposition that it is raining right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction: We all think \"Bayesian\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayesian method requires that we be explicit about our uncertainty up-front and update our beliefs in the light of new evidence or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features of Bayesian inference:\n",
    "- Probability encodes our degree of certainty or uncertainty.\n",
    "- Unknown parameters are modelled as probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use Bayesian inference?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Because it is correct. Bayes' theorem is a theorem. If you accept the axioms of probability theory, it is true. You can ignore it, but it won't go away.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Because it is useful for applications.\n",
    "3. You can incorporate your existing knowledge into the model, known as a prior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This last point is interesting. If you have some *a priori* knowledge of the event (either intuition or something more formal), you can set this as a prior in your model. This leads to faster training of your model (assuming your prior is somewhat accurate) and can lead to the discover of better models.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Applications of Bayesian inference include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- prediction (e.g. outcome of an election, behaviour of asset prices, ...)\n",
    "- classification (does a person with these symptoms have this disease?; OCR; speech recognition)\n",
    "- scientific inference\n",
    "- hypothesis testing (single and multiple)\n",
    "- modelling\n",
    "- uncertainty analysis\n",
    "- physics: thermodynamics, crystallography, astronomy, ...\n",
    "- biology and medicine: bioinformatics (sequencing), predicting drug targets\n",
    "- ranking for information retrieval, spam detection, ... and other computer science applications\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to do Bayesian inference?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Method 1: **mathematical analysis**. This is exact but requires heroic integration skills, which makes it hard to begin in the field. A more important drawback is that it tends to be intractable for complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Method 2: **probabilistic programming**. Computing power is cheap! Using simulation allows models to be more complex."

    "### Probability as logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian statistics was previously called the \"method of inverse probability\" -- reasoning backwards from what we observe about the world to make quantitative inferences. Here is how [Jaynes 2003] introduces its relationship to other forms of inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deductive reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "Deductive reason can be analyzed into repeated application of two syllogisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "If A is true, then B is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "A is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, B is true.\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "and its inverse:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "If B is false, then A is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "B is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, A is false.\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these are only valid for the true/false values above. For instance, this reasoning in **invalid**: \"If A is true, then B is true -> A is false, therefore B is false\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuitive reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "As [Jaynes 2003] notes, we would like to use this kind of reasoning all the time, but most of the time **we do not have the right kind of information**. We fall back on weaker syllogisms like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "If A is true, then B is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "B is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, A becomes more plausible.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: probability of rain**\n",
    "\n",
    "A $\\equiv$ it will start to rain by 10am at the latest.\n",
    "\n",
    "B $\\equiv$ the sky will become cloudy before 10am.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you notice clouds at 9:45am, your common sense obeys the weak syllogism above. You are more likely to take an umbrella.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the logical connection?\n",
    "\n",
    "rain $\\implies$ clouds\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the physical cause is in the opposite direction:\n",
    "\n",
    "clouds $\\implies$ rain\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: the **logical connection** is what is most relevant to our inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weak syllogism 2\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other weaker syllogisms that we use every day in our reasoning, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "If A is true, then B becomes more plausible.\n",
    "\n",
    "A is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, B becomes less plausible.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: disease symptoms**\n",
    "\n",
    "Symptoms of the Zika virus include conjunctivitis (red eyes) and skin rash.\n",
    "\n",
    "This traveller doesn't have conjunctivitis or skin rash. Therefore, it is less likely that he/she has the Zika virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weak syllogism 3\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "If A is true, then B becomes more plausible.\n",
    "\n",
    "B is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, A becomes more plausible.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Aston-Martin owners are usually rich.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bill Gates is rich.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is more likely that Bill Gates owns an Aston-Martin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aside\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more complex weak syllogisms that we use easily and intuitively in everyday reasoning. Polya [1945, 1954] wrote three books about plausible reasoning, pointing out many interesting examples and showing that we do plausible reasoning by applying definite rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Meaning for probability theory\n",
    "\n",
    "These principles may be made **quantitative**, with useful applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "How? With the Cox-Jaynes interpretation of probability theory and **Bayes theorem**.\n",
