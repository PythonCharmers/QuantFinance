    "### 2.3.1 Statistical Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to test the results of an experiment, a normal pattern is to setup a Control and treatment group. The terminology comes from medical science, but applies to any field. The Control group is \"do the task as you have previously done\", or \"keep everything normal\". The Treatment group is \"apply my idea to this group\". We then evaluate the different in the two groups to determine if there is a difference or not - normally referred to as a *significant* difference, but we will come back to that term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a new trading algorithm (we'll call NEW) we want to test. The current one works (named OLD) well enough, but initial testing of NEW indicates some good results. Given the random nature of the stock market, and randomness inherent in both the NEW and OLD algorithms, we can't just run them once and compare the results. In statistics, we always want to ask \"Isn't there some probability that this difference happened by chance?\". Statistics helps us protect against making decisions based on (un)lucky data sampling that happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create 30 iterations of both NEW and OLD, and backtest on the last 5 years of trading data. We get the following profits:"

    "### A common misconception with p\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people misinterpret what a p value means. Let's say we have our original result of NEW and OLD (the one with 30 samples each). A common misinterpretation of the \"high\" p value is to say there is \"no difference\" between the two samples. If we are measuring a correlation and get a high p value, one might say there is \"no correlation\", even if we do get a linear correlation value, just one that has a high p value. In these cases, one would be wrong to say this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our observed difference was 0.08 - not \"no difference\". There is just a 33.6% chance that randomly doing the experiment would yield the same, or higher, result.\n",
    "\n",
    "[This article in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9) gives an example of two experiments on the same treatment - an anti-inflammatory drug. Both experiments tested if there was a correlation between using the drug and new-onset atrial fibrillation. One paper concludes the drug is associated with the condition. One paper concludes that it is not associated with the condition. Which is correct? \n",
    "\n",
    "In the \"no association\" experiment, the 95% confidence interval spanned between a decrease of 3% of the risk of the condition to a 48% increase in risk. However, due to the statistical test, the confidence interval included 0, indicating that there is greater than 5% chance that the increased risk observed was due to chance. The Nature article calculated the p value as 0.091.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"association\" experiment found the 95% confidence interval between a 9% increased risk to a 33% increased risk. As zero is not in the confidence interval, they concluded that there was an association.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the key finding - both experiments had a mean increased risk of 20%. The second experiment just had more data. An average increased risk of 20% for atrial fibrillation is **significant**. Data sample size indicated that it was not **statistically significant** in the first \"no association\" experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are calls from lots of scientists to stop using the term \"statistically significant\". Further, studies have shown about *half* of papers wrongly interpret their p values. The issue isn't so much with the tests themselves, it is the interpretation of the tests that is the problem, and the common \"intuition\" that \"not statistically significant\" means \"no difference\" or \"not important\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To make matters worse, most people will use 0.05 as their threshold without any consideration for what this means, and whether such a value makes sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to be clear with what your test results present, and how they could be used in decision making. Do not use shortcuts like \"statistically significant\", when key decisions (like your p value threshold of 0.05 or your \"95%\" confidence interval) are arbitrarily defined. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the linked Nature article on problems with P values: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9\n",
    "2. Write a summary (about two or three sentences) explaining the results of the 30-sample NEW versus OLD result. Be clear on terminology. You can compute confidence intervals as well to present these findings, but again, be clear about what that means.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are doing this course with a group or partner, get them to check your explanation, and discuss whether you would move to NEW based on the summary you presented.\n",
