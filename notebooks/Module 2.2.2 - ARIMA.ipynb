    "### The ARIMA model\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the issues with the ARMA model is that it requires data to be stationary before the algorithm begins. A normal step for turning non-stationary data into stationary data is to difference the data, either once or twice. Therefore, a normal process is to difference the data and then run ARMA. A problem with this is that we have a two step methodology to describe. ARIMA captures this idea in a single model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ARIMA model is a more general form of the ARMA model. Specifically, ARMA(p, q) is an ARIMA(p, 0, q) model. The $p$ and $q$ values are the same as the ARMA model. The middle parameter is $d$, for differencing. The ARIMA model will apply differencing to turn a non-stationary dataset into a stationary one, allowing the AR and MA processes to model them better. That's the same as our two step process above, just captured nicely. And a lot more useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "That gives the full ARIMA model as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ARIMA(p, d, q)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p$ is the lag in the autoregressive model and $q$ is the lag in the moving-average model, and $d$ is the order of differencing applied (i.e. how many times to difference the data to get a stationary series).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ARIMA model can also be identified by having components \"turned off\", i.e. set to zero. We saw above that ARIMA(p, 0, q) is simply the ARMA(p, q) model. Further, ARIMA(0, 0, q) is simply MA(q). ARIMA(0, 1, 1) is IMA(1, 1), although that is more obscure than other variants you'll see."

    "When performing a grid search (in other words, \"try all combinations of these values for the parameters\") you can keep your search space small by trying 0, 1, 2 and 3 as the only options (and just 0, 1, 2 for $d$). If that model isn't sufficient, **and** you have a good theoretical reason for a different value. For seasonal change, for instance, if you suspect a yearly trend (this June's data will be dependent on last June's), then seasonal ARIMA is needed, which we will cover later in this module."

    "Seasonal variations are not included by default in an ARIMA model. You can approximate this with lag periods of your season, for instance, setting $d=12$. A Seasonal ARIMA model has parameters for both the standard ARIMA model, and additional ones for the seasonality. This gives the full model as: \n",

    "\n",
    "Where $p$, $d$ and $q$ are as with ARIMA, and $P$, $D$, and $Q$ are the same as their lowercase version, except with a seasonal lag added in. For example,  D is seasonal lag, setting $y_t = y_t - y_{t-M}$ where $M$ is the seasonal lag period (if you have monthly data and want yearly differencing, $M=12$).\n",
    "\n",
    "As with ARIMA, and all the model we have seen so far, any of these values could be zero, effectively turning that part of the model off. Unlike non-seasonal ARIMA, we normally still refer to the model by it's full name, i.e. ARIMA(0, 0, 1)(1, 1, 0), (as opposed to, say, MASAR(1, 1) or some weird combination).\n",

    "#### Extended Exercise Automating parameter selection\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw above, choosing parameters for ARIMA is a fairly straight-forward process, using AIC to choose the best from a subset of features. This process is easily automatable, and has been automated in a few libraries. In the R programming language, the ARIMA implementation already includes it, while it is a separate module for statsmodels in Python. You can get the code from https://github.com/tgsmith61591/pmdarima\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the package on your system and run on the data you received for the exercises in this module (cryptocurrency and seasonal commodity). What parameters does it choose, and how effective was the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a warning, automated parameter selection is basically a brute force selection. Generally it composes the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try all parameter combinations from those given\n",
    "2. Evaluate all of them using some metric\n",
    "3. Choose the best one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some algorithms exist separately to optimise and improve this process by being a bit more clever about their search, but these options are not available in `pmdarima`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the documenation for this library also contains additional information on choosing parameter bounds that is worth reading for a more complete picture of ARIMA."
