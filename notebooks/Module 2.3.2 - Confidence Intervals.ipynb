    "A statistical analysis without discussion of confidence or range is not complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is about dealing with uncertainty, and when a statistical analysis gives a confident \"the mean is 3.2\" result, there is information missing here, specifically around how confident we are in that result and where we can reasonably expect the *actual* value to end up. This is also why political polls jump around so much in the news - they don't really, just that newspapers rarely report confidence intervals, so when sample mean naturally jumps around, this is the only value that is reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals are a key measure to use here, and one of the easiest to explain, especially to non-statistical stakeholders. A confidence interval for a given estimate, at a given threshold X% is an interval for where X% of the expected values sit in that interval. Let's look at an example:"

See `scipy.stats.norm.interval` for information on how to do this for a normal distribution. One example that most have heard about is \"for a normal distribution, 95% of values fit within two standard errors\".\n",

Create many bootstrap samples (same size as the original sample, however sampled with replacement) and compute the statistic for each bootstrap sample. After sorting, take the value 2.5% of the way through the data, and 97.5% of the way through. This range is the 95% confidence interval. This process is generally known as the bootstrap method.\n",

For instance, if the 95% confidence interval for the slope of a line contains 0, some would say there is a possibility of \"no correlation\" between the two. As noted in the last notebook, this confuses the term and is not a reliable methodology to use.\n",

    "Like p-values, confidence intervals are often misinterpreted. If you get a confidence interval of $a$ and $b$, this does **not** mean that 95% of individual measurements will fit between $a$ and $b$. It means that when we take samples (of the same size we used to compute the confidence interval), 95% of the values for the calculated statistic (such as the mean), will fit inside those bounds.\n",

Saying \"the confidence interval for average height is between 162 and 182cm\" is better than saying \"the confidence interval is between 162.243cm and 182.976cm\", because the latter makes it seem like the process is much more formal than it really is. Remember you likely just used a 95% confidence interval because that's what most people use.\n",

The resampling method used in bootstrap statistics allows for us to calculate arbitrary statistics from the dataset.\n",
