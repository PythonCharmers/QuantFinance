    "This module will also cover some background material on getting installed on your system, and some other notes on how to use these notebooks.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. How to use Jupyter Notebooks, including Markdown cells and exporting to PDF\n",
    "2. How to complete exercises and check your solutions work with *pytest*\n",
    "3. Python versions, and writing compatible code in both Python 2 and Python 3\n",
    "4. The Altair library for visualisations (we will use this extensively throughout the course)\n",
    "5. Different types of data (discrete and continuous) and how to generate random variables from them.\n",
    "6. Normal distributions, their properties and testing for normality\n",
    "7. Z-scores and moments"
